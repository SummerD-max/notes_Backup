Experimental results on synthetic and real 
networks show that the MLPA outperforms many other 
methods, including existing label propagation algorithms for 
the detection of overlapping communities. It confirms that 
the introduction of the closeness between vertices into label 
propagation can significantly improve the detecting 
performance on overlapping communities.

MLPA outperforms many other methods, including existing label propagation algorithms for the detection of overlapping communities. However, MLPA is not a perfect algorithm, its main current shortcoming is that
