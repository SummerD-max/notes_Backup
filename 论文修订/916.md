#### 先回复评论者的问题，然后再写我们在论文的哪个部分补充了哪些内容


**比如（response2）:**

2.Thank you for your comment. **We add supplementary explanation on the effect of D(.) in section 4.4, page 6 of the paper.** D(.) Is the decryption function in the homomorphic encryption algorithm, hope to help you understand the paper better.

**其中粗体部分应该放在后面**

- 英语要写得简洁一点，这一点我继续改进。

#### comment3
**hash 函数为什么能保护信息？**
**Answer**：比如利用它的 property ： 单向，攻击者无法通过经过散列函数映射后的值反向推导出ID的信息

Answer：

**A hash function is a mathematical function that converts a numerical input value into another compressed numerical value. The input to the hash function is of arbitrary length but output is always of fixed length. The hash function has the property that protects against an attacker who only has a hash value and is trying to find the input. So it would be computationally hard for an attacker to infer the ID through the hash result.**

老师说不用解释“不同颜色代表了不同的参与者”

#### comment5

5.Thank you for your valueable suggestions. We further explains “Why SDMLPA's performance declines with the increase of the number of participants while FMLPA's does not in table 3” in section 5.6 on page 10 of our paper. SDMLPA's performance declines with the increase of the number of participants because it simply **sums up(可以改成merges)** the results of all participant. **However(改成on the contrary)**, Since the results of FMLPA are the same as ACOPRA, FMLPA’s performance is not affected by the growth of participants.

#### comment6
Thank you for your comment. we **will change reference’s order(改成 have rearranged the references)** so that references are **arranges(arranged)** in the order of their citations.
